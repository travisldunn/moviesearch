# Movie Search

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Challenges

I think the hardest part of this challenge was understanding the Movie Database. Working with so much data is always difficult but once I understood the request structure I was on my way. I was able to find most of the solutions to my problems by reading the database's documentation.

## Design

I wanted a simple design to match the simplicity of the app. This app is more about viewing the information so I focused most of the design elements around making the information individualized and easy to read.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time I would add a share button as well as individual display for a selected movie. This display would show all of the information stored on the database for that particular movie.
